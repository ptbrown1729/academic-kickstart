  I graduated from the University of Chicago with a bachelor's degree in physics and mathematics in 2013. I earned a Ph.D. in physics from Princeton University in 2019, where I <a href="http://ultracold.princeton.edu/">worked</a> in the fields of ultracold atoms and quantum simulation. Most recently, I have joined the <a href="https://shepherdlaboratory.org/">quantitative imaging and inference</a> lab in the Center for Biological Physics at Arizona State University.

My research interests include developing new microscopy techniques, structured illumination microscopy, super resolution micriscopy, quantum gas microscopy, atomic physics, strongly correlated matter, many-body physics, Fermi gases, fermions in optical lattices, quantum magnetism, low-dimensional quantum systems, transport properties of strongly correlated systems, Hubbard physics, Rydberg atoms, and long-range interactions in quantum gases.
