I am a physicist broadly interested in quantitative microscopy and quantum simulation of complex systems. My research interests include super resolution mciroscopy, structured illumination microscopy, quantum gas microscopy, atomic physics, strongly correlated matter, many-body physics, Fermi gases, fermions in optical lattices, quantum magnetism, low-dimensional quantum systems, transport properties of strongly correlated systems, Hubbard physics, Rydberg atoms, and long-range interactions in quantum gases.


I first became interested in quantum science while working in the <a href="http://schusterlab.uchicago.edu/">Schuster lab</a> at the University of Chicago, where I earned a bachelor's degree in physics and mathematics in 2013. Next, moving away from frabricated quantum systems, I studied ultracold atoms in optical lattices and quantum simulation in Waseem Bakr's <a href="http://ultracold.princeton.edu/">group</a> at Princeton University. Despite the considerable technological differences between artificial quantum systems and atoms, much of the physics is closely related. Atoms are pristine quantum devices, and we do not even need to fabricate them ourselves. I earned a Ph.D. in physics from Princeton University in 2019, where my research was focused on experimental exploration of static and transport properties of the 2D Fermi-Hubbard model. Our primary tool for these experiments was a quantum gas microscope. While building and running this apparatus, I developed a quantitative understanding of optics and imaging, which are necessities for extracting quantitative information from cold atom experiments.

Most recently I have joined the <a href="https://shepherdlaboratory.org/">quantitative imaging and inference</a> lab in the Center for Biological Physics at Arizona State University where I am working to develop quantitative microscopy tools for use with super resolution imaging. I am currently working to develop a multicolor structured illumination microscope (SIM) with coherent light and a digital mirror device (DMD).
